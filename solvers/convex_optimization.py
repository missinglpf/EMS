""" Convex optimization problem sovlers
The following solvers are included in the package
1) linear constrained quadratic programming
2) quadratic constrained quadratic programming
3) linear conic programming
4) semi-defined programming
The original method is borrowed from cvxopt, which can be obtained from the following website:
http://cvxopt.org/
It should be noted that, in cvxopt, advanced modelling language is required to accelerate the computation.
In this system,only basic methods are implemented
